	I am departing from New York, USA in August and will return in March. My budget is ultra-luxury travel $1000+ per day, and I prefer street food. I will be traveling partner for one month, and I enjoy camping. I prefer a remote village destination with cold weather. My transportation preference is public transport. My trip is in spring, and I am interested in F1 races. The local language should be French-speaking, and I need a electronic travel authorization destination. My trip should be n, and my adventure level is extreme. For nightlife, I prefer beach parties. I prefer locations with low-crime area and service dog friendly support. I am interested in a cultural experience with sustainable tourism focus. I will also be adding guided city tours to my trip.
	
### Processing Steps \
Step 1: Process images: \
	Extract image embeddings folder: image_embeddings_extraction.py -> return a csv image_embeddings.csv (512,)

Step 2: Process user text prompts: \
	Generate 100k synthetic prompts to fine tune the T5 model to generate raw extracted criteria \
	Output from LLM then go through evaluate.py -> clean user_preference.json \
	Extract the embedding from the user_preference.json \

Step 3: Create multi_modal_user_embedding = $\alpha$ * image_embeddings + $\beta$ * text_embeddings \
($\alpha$ and $\beta$ hyperparameter deciding the relative importance of images versus text prompts)

Step 3: Query Knowledge Base

	Visual Matching:
    	Match image embeddings with database image features:
        	Top matches: Bali (Indonesia), Phuket (Thailand), and Huaraz (Peru).
	Textual Matching:
    	Match keywords like "peaceful beach," "scenic views," "good weather," and "March":
        	Filtered destinations: Bali, Phuket.
	Final Match:
    	Combine visual and textual scores, filter by budget and weather:
        	Final recommendation: Bali, Indonesia.

Step 4: Fetch Live Data

	Use APIs to fetch additional dynamic information:
    	Cheapest Flight: $750 round trip (via Skyscanner).
    	Hotel: $70 per night for a beachfront villa (via Booking.com).
    	Weather: Sunny, 27°C average in March (via OpenWeatherMap).



UI: after the user input, make a world map, where there are several red dots that users can hover, when they hover to that red dot, information about the location appears: images, link to the cheapest flight (maybe SkyScanner API), current weather…., and maybe a suggested tour.
We can also try to extract whether they are travelling alone, couple, family… -> suggest tour accordingly
